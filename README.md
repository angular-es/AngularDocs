# AngularDocs
## Bot for angular docs on python


[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/593256013008994305.svg?label=Discord&logo=discord&color=7289DA&labelColor=2C2F33)](https://discord.gg/2FD5sbe)

This is a simple couple of instructions in python and hosted in Google cloud 

## commands 
the prefix command to invoke the bot is `$`
example `$help` to show commands or `$info` to show about the server 
We are currently working in a DRY way to show all the content the sugestion is:
Example 
`$animations`then show a description and a code example and a more message with url 
maybe the best way is add a subfix like: 
`$animation docs`
`$animation example`
`$animation usage`
`$animation syntax`

this will keep clear the questions and the answers
As a suggestion use a structure like the api list in the official documentation
https://angular.io/api
